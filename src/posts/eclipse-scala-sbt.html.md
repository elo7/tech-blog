Recently we started a new project here in Elo7 and this is a quick guide to help you to configure a new Scala project using SBT to manage your project dependencies and Eclipse as your IDE.

### So... what is SBT?

> "sbt is a build tool for Scala and Java projects that aims to do the basics well&" fromÂ scala-sbt.org

It manages your dependencies (using Apache Ivy) and supports mixed projects with Scala and Java.

### Installing SBT

If you have homebrew in your mac

``` bash
$ brew install sbt
```

If you are using another platforms [refer to this site](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html#installing-sbt)

### Create a simple project

Create a new folder for your project

``` bash
$ mkdir hello_scala
```

go to your new project folder and create a build.sbt file

``` bash
$ cd hello_scala
$ vim build.sbt
```

This file describe your project and your dependencies, write the following to your file

``` scala
name := "hello_scala"
version := "1.0"
scalaVersion := "2.10.2"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.specs2" %% "specs2" % "2.1.1" % "test",
  "junit" % "junit" % "4.11" % "test"
)

resolvers ++= Seq(
  "snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots",
  "releases" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"
)
```

Here we are adding two dependencies to write unit tests, [junit](http://junit.org/ "JUnit") and [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/ "Specs2"), and two extra resolvers for your dependencies. This is needed since SBT by default only have the Maven default repository in its list.

After this you will need to add a [SBT Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse).

``` bash
$ mkdir project
$ echo "addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.2.0")" >> plugins.sbt
```

go to your project root directory and

``` bash
$ sbt eclipse
```

This will download all your dependencies, create your eclipse project files and add your dependencies to project library.

### In your eclipse!

Import your project and you are ready to go!

The project generated with sbt adds several source files directories, separating java source files from scala source files and tests from main code.

Saying Hello to the World!

``` scala
object Hi {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = println("Hello World!")
}
```

go to your console and in your project root directory type:

``` bash
$ sbt run
```
